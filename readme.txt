== Description ==

This plugin allows you to upload Processing (p5.js) Projects to your WordPress website. The Processing Projects you upload should be in a zip file that contains all the files required to run the project.

Uploaded Processing Projects can then be displayed anywhere on your website using the shortcode [pp-shortcode id="0"]. Make sure to replace "0" in the shortcode with the ID of your project.

The shortcode also accepts width and height arguments. This allows you to set the size of the iframe used to display the Processing Project on your website, eg [pp-shortcode id="0" width="960" height="500"].

The shortcodes for all the Processing Projects you upload will be displayed on the Processing Projects table for easy access.
